In a world of constant digital threats, your password is your first line of defense. **Digital Sentinel** is your personal security advisor, designed to help everyone‚Äîfrom the tech-savvy to the everyday internet user‚Äîinstantly understand and improve their password security.

It demystifies the complex world of cybersecurity by providing clear, actionable intelligence on your passwords, checking for data breach exposure, and offering personalized, AI-powered advice to help you stay one step ahead of threats.

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Password Strength Analysis**
    *   **What it does:** Instantly evaluates your password's strength based on complexity, length, and predictability.
    *   **Why it matters:** It gives you a clear, immediate score so you know exactly where you stand and can stop using weak credentials.

*   **Privacy-Preserving Breach Check**
    *   **What it does:** Securely checks if your password has appeared in known data breaches without ever exposing your full password online.
    *   **Why it matters:** You can find out if your accounts are at risk from past breaches, empowering you to take action before it's too late.

*   **AI-Powered Security Advisor**
    *   **What it does:** Provides personalized, context-aware security advice generated by an advanced AI based on your password's specific weaknesses.
    *   **Why it matters:** Instead of generic tips, you get tailored recommendations that are easy to understand and act upon, making you genuinely safer.

*   **Secure Password Generator**
    *   **What it does:** Creates strong, random, and cryptographically secure passwords tailored to your specifications.
    *   **Why it matters:** It eliminates the guesswork and human error in creating new passwords, ensuring every new account is protected from the start.

*   **Hacker Time-to-Crack Simulation**
    *   **What it does:** Estimates how long it would take a modern hacking setup to brute-force your password.
    *   **Why it matters:** This tangible metric makes the abstract concept of "password strength" real and understandable.

## üß± How It Works

Digital Sentinel works like a personal cybersecurity consultant. When you enter a password, it first runs a local checkup, scoring its strength based on factors like length and character mix.

Then, to check for public exposure, it cleverly sends only the first five characters of a scrambled (hashed) version of your password to a massive database of breached passwords. This allows it to see if your password is on the list without ever revealing the password itself.

Finally, it feeds all this information to an onboard AI, which acts as a security expert, analyzing the results and writing personalized, actionable advice just for you.

## üèÜ Why It Stands Out

1.  **Integrated AI Advisor:** Unlike tools that just give a "good" or "bad" rating, Digital Sentinel provides personalized, contextual advice from an AI, explaining *why* a password is weak and *how* to improve your overall security posture.
2.  **Complete Security Loop:** It‚Äôs an all-in-one toolkit. You can analyze a password, see if it's breached, get advice on how to improve it, and generate a new, secure one‚Äîall in a single, seamless workflow.
3.  **Privacy-First by Design:** The breach-checking mechanism is built on a k-Anonymity model, ensuring your full password is never transmitted, offering peace of mind that other "checkers" may not.

## üîÆ Future Vision

*   **Team & Family Security Hub:** An upcoming feature will allow users to create a secure dashboard to manage and monitor the password health of a small team or family, promoting collective security without sharing actual passwords.
*   **Breach Alert System:** We're developing an opt-in service that will proactively monitor for new data breaches and alert you if your email address appears, so you can take immediate action.

### Getting Started with Development

This is a Next.js project. To get started locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/digital-sentinel.git
    cd digital-sentinel
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file and configure it based on `.env.example` (if available). You will need to set up your Ollama instance for the AI features.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.
